    "\n",
    "To run simulations with parameter optimization against TSST data, there is no need to change any cells until the heading **Run the Optimization**. Simply run all cells up to the cell below that heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set which data set to optimize parameters against, look for the following line of code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    data_to_match = [nelson.ACTH[:,0], nelson.ACTH[:,1], nelson.cortisol[:,0], nelson.cortisol[:,1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run against a patient from the TSST data sets, simply change the list entries to reflect the patient number and subject group. The subject groups are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nelson.melancholicACTH & nelson.melancholicCortisol (15 patients)\n",

    "\n",
    "You could also run against the mean of all patients cortisol and ACTH concentration values by using `nelson.ACTH[:,1]` and `nelson.cortisol[:,1]`. Or you can run against the mean of any subgroup using `nelson.<subgroup name>Cortisol_mean[:,1]` and `nelson.<subgroup name>ACTH_mean[:,1]` (for instance `nelson.melancholicCortisol_mean[:,1]` & `nelson.melancholicACTH_mean[:,1]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first column in each data set is the time steps, so indexing with `[:,0]` is referring to the time. These are the values we need to set as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices of the `data_to_match` list.\n",

    "It is unlikely that you will need to optimize any initial conditions (ICs), because the only ICs other than ACTH and cortisol are inflammatory cytokines. However, if necessary, this can be modified in the function `cost_fun(params)`. In the example below, we use the first three optimized parameters in the list returned by the optimization algorithm to set the ICs we want to optimize (LPS, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in this example):\n",
    "\n",
    "    y0 = [params[0], params[1], params[2], y0[1], y0[2]]\n",

    "\n",
    "    simData = model(params[3:], y0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you want to not optimize any ICs, you would simply leave the cost function as it is currently written.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you are ready to run the optimization, so simply run the cells up to the heading **Save Output to File**. This may take some time, so while it is running you can move on to the next steps (if you run a cell while another is processing, it will add it to a queue).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You also have the option of using a cost function based on the maximum distance between simulation and real-world data. Simply change SSE_cost to MAX_cost, the instructions for function arguments remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell directly under the heading **Save Output to File** can be changed so that the root filename matches the simulations being run. This root will be used to save all of the various data and figures generated. The current naming scheme would save the files for 5 iterations of parameter optimization against the mean data set from the Nelson with ICs for CRH and GR optimized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filename_root = \"malekModel_output/nelson-patientMean-5-iterations-ICOpt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This saves the files in a subfolder specific to this model, which helps keep files organized when running multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few cells create an Excel file containing all of the concentration data and optimized parameter values, and text files containing the initial conditions, parameter bounds and parameter means +- standard deviation across the 5 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step after saving the outputs is to plot the simulations against the real-world data. The cell under the heading **Plots** creates an instance of the Visualizer object from the VeVaPy module called visualize. This will start a dialog which asks for several inputs to generate figures as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization of the object, run its method `make_graphs()`, and it will generate figures using the data you have specified. There are a number of arguments that can be optionally specified for this method, and you can see more details by running the command:\n",

    "Since these data sets have data points over a 24-hour period (1440 minutes), rather than 140.5 minutes, you will need to change the time interval over which the ODE solver integrates. To do this, go to the cell directly above the heading **Put Raw Data Into Arrays** and uncomment (delete the # at the start of the line) the lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    t_start = -0.5\n",
    "    t_end = 1455.5\n",
    "    t_step = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to comment out the other definitons for these variables (place a # at the start of the line).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you add the extra 15 minutes is that you need to make sure that when you interpolate between your simulated data points the line covers every real-world data point so that you don't cause issues when computing the cost function (and the last data point for the Golier cortisol concentration data sets is at 1455 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "After making this change, you need to again change the `data_to_match` list so that you are matching the basal data set in which you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, choose which data set you wish to match. Here are the options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- yehuda.controlCortisol\n",
    "- yehuda.PTSDCortisol\n",
    "- yehuda.depressedCortisol\n",
    "- carroll.controlCortisol & carroll.controlACTH\n",
    "- carroll.LCDepressedCortisol & carroll.LCDepressedACTH (LC = Low Cortisol)\n",
    "- carroll.HCDepressedCortisol & carroll.HCDepressedACTH (HC = High Cortisol)\n",
    "- golier.PTSDCortisol & golierPTSDACTH\n",
    "- golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedCortisol & golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedACTH\n",
    "- golier.nonPTSDNonExposedCortisol & golier.nonPTSDNonExposedACTH\n",
    "- bremner.abusedPTSDCortisol\n",
    "- bremner.nonAbusedPTSDCortisol\n",
    "- bremner.nonAbusedNonPTSDCortisol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To see what any of these data sets looks like, click on the **Plot Basal Data Sets** heading in the Table of Contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note Also:** These data sets all come in smoothed versions (each data point is set to the average of the nearest 5 points of the unsmoothed data). Also, the data sets by Carroll, Golier and Bremner also come in rearranged (or smoothed & rearranged) versions to match the starting time of the Yehuda data (10AM). To use any of these versions, simply append one of the following tags to the end of the data set name (before the indices): `_smooth`, `_rearr`, or `_rearr_smooth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will cover what to do with data sets that contain both ACTH and cortisol values, and then afterwards I will cover using the Yehuda and Bremner data sets (which have only cortisol concentration data). Just as with the Nelson data, in all of these data sets the first column is the time step values. This means that if you take any of these arrays and index it with `[:,0]`, you are referring to the time steps. These are the values we need to use as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices in the `data_to_match` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for the second and fourth indices, you index the same data sets with `[:,1]` to mean the second column (which contains the mean concentration values for each patient group).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of examples showing lists you can use for optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `carroll.controlACTH_smooth[:,0], carroll.controlACTH_smooth[:,1], carroll.controlCortisol_smooth[:,0], carroll.controlCortisol_smooth[:,1]`\n",
    "    - The smoothed Control group mean for the Carroll data set\n",
    "- `golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedACTH[:,0], golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedACTH[:,1], golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedCortisol[:,0], golier.nonPTSDTraumaExposedCortisol[:,1]`\n",
    "    - The Trauma-Exposed Control group mean for the Golier data set\n",
    "    \n",
    "In order to run simulations against data sets that do not include ACTH concentration data, you will need to change the name of the cost function to `optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH` and then update `data_to_match` to not include the two arguments for ACTH data. To use the Yehuda Control group data, this would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data_to_match = [yehuda.controlCortisol[:,0], yehuda.controlCortisol[:,1]]\n",
    "    return optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH(data_to_match[0], data_to_match[1], simData)\n",
    "\n",
    "For data without ACTH concentrations, you will also need to comment out the current definition of `y0` and uncomment the following line (and change the IC to the desired value for ACTH):\n",
    "\n",
    "    #y0 = [0, 0, 0, 10, data_to_match[1][0]]\n",
    "    \n",
    "At this point, you're ready to run the parameter optimization, so run all of the cells under the heading **Run the Optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell directly under the heading **Save Output to File** should again have the filename changed to something that reflects the data set you're matching now. For instance, the filename root when matching the smoothed Carroll Control group and optimizing ICs would become:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filename_root = 'malekModel_output/carroll-control-smooth-5-iterations-ICopt'\n",
    "            \n",
    "Finally, the cells under the heading **Plots** should be run again to generate graphs. The same process of giving inputs to the object dialog will be performed and then the method `make_graphs()` should be run with any optional arguments desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Without Parameter Optimization <a name=\"noOptInstructions\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the model with any set of paramaters you desire, without optimization, you can use the cells under the heading **No Optimization Run**. Change the parameters and initial conditions defined under the heading **Parameters and Initial Conditions**, and then run the cell containing the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data_no_opt = model(authors_params, y0)\n",
    "    \n",
