    "**Note:** To quickly run a cell (or a selection of cells), use the shortcut Shift+Enter (or you can also use the button labeled \"Run\" in the toolbar at the top).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run simulations with parameter optimization against TSST data, there is no need to change any cells until the heading **Run the Optimization**. Simply run all cells up to the cell below that heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set which data set to optimize parameters against, look for the following line of code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    data_to_match = [nelson.ACTH[:,0], nelson.ACTH[:,1], nelson.cortisol[:,0], nelson.cortisol[:,1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run against a patient from the TSST data sets, simply change the list entries to reflect the patient number and subject group. The subject groups are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nelson.melancholicACTH & nelson.melancholicCortisol (15 patients)\n",

    "- nelson.neitherACTH & nelson.neitherCortisol (14 patients)\n",
    "- nelson.healthyACTH & nelson.healthyCortisol (15 patients)\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also run against the mean of all patients cortisol and ACTH concentration values by using `nelson.ACTH[:,1]` and `nelson.cortisol[:,1]`. Or you can run against the mean of any subgroup using `nelson.<subgroup name>Cortisol_mean[:,1]` and `nelson.<subgroup name>ACTH_mean[:,1]` (for instance `nelson.melancholicCortisol_mean[:,1]` & `nelson.melancholicACTH_mean[:,1]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first column in each data set is the time steps, so indexing with `[:,0]` is referring to the time. These are the values we need to set as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices of the `data_to_match` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are several examples of lists you could use for parameter optimization with explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nelson.melancholicACTH[:,0], nelson.melancholicACTH[:,1], nelson.melancholicCortisol[:,0], nelson.melancholicCortisol[:,1]`\n",

    "    - The mean of all control patients\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, you need to decide whether you will optimize any initial conditions (ICs). This can be modified in the function `cost_fun(params)`. In the cost function, we use the first two optimized parameters in the list returned by the optimization algorithm to set the ICs we want to optimize (CRH and GR in this example):\n",
    "\n",
    "    y0 = [params[0], y0[1], y0[2], params[1]]\n",

    "\n",
    "    simData = model(params[2:], y0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you want to not optimize any ICs, you would simply comment out the two lines above in `cost_fun()`, and uncomment the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #simData = model(params, y0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In that case, you will likely want to change the ICs for CRH and GR, as they will stay the same for every iteration. Under the heading **Run the Optimization**, the following line should be modified to reflect the desired ICs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y0 = [0, data_to_match[1][0], data_to_match[3][0], 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Be sure to leave the 2nd and 3rd indices unchanged, as these set the ICs to use the initial values of the real-world data set being matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you are ready to run the optimization, so simply run the cells up to the heading **Save Output to File**. This may take some time, so while it is running you can move on to the next steps (if you run a cell while another is processing, it will add it to a queue).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You also have the option of using a cost function based on the maximum distance between simulation and real-world data. Simply change SSE_cost to MAX_cost, the instructions for function arguments remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell directly under the heading **Save Output to File** can be changed so that the root filename matches the simulations being run. This root will be used to save all of the various data and figures generated. The current naming scheme would save the files for 5 iterations of parameter optimization against the mean data set from the Nelson with ICs for CRH and GR optimized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filename_root = \"sriramModel_output/nelson-patientMean-5-iterations-ICOpt\"\n",

    "The next few cells create an Excel file containing all of the concentration data and optimized parameter values, and text files containing the initial conditions, parameter bounds and parameter means +- standard deviation across the 5 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step after saving the outputs is to plot the simulations against the real-world data. The cell under the heading **Plots** creates an instance of the Visualizer object from the VeVaPy module called visualize. This will start a dialog which asks for several inputs to generate figures as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization of the object, run its method `make_graphs()`, and it will generate figures using the data you have specified.

    "Since these data sets have data points over a 24-hour period, rather than 2.35 hours, you will need to change the time interval over which the ODE solver integrates. To do this, go to the cell directly above the heading **Put Raw Data Into Arrays** and change the value of t_end to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    t_end = 24.26\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you add the extra 0.26 hours is that you need to make sure that when you interpolate between your simulated data points the line covers every real-world data point so that you don't cause issues when computing the cost function (and the last data point for the Golier cortisol concentration data sets is at 24.25 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "After making this change, you need to again change the `data_to_match` list so that you are matching the basal data set in which you are interested.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note Also:** These data sets all come in smoothed versions (each data point is set to the average of the nearest 5 points of the unsmoothed data). Also, the data sets by Carroll, Golier and Bremner also come in rearranged (or smoothed & rearranged) versions to match the starting time of the Yehuda data (10AM). To use any of these versions, simply append one of the following tags to the end of the data set name (before the indices): `_smooth`, `_rearr`, or `_rearr_smooth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will cover what to do with data sets that contain both ACTH and cortisol values, and then afterwards I will cover using the Yehuda and Bremner data sets (which have only cortisol concentration data). Just as with the Nelson data, in all of these data sets the first column is the time step values. This means that if you take any of these arrays and index it with `[:,0]`, you are referring to the time steps. These are the values we need to use as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices in the `data_to_match` list.\n",

    "    - The Trauma-Exposed Control group mean for the Golier data set\n",
    "    \n",
    "In order to run simulations against data sets that do not include ACTH concentration data, you will need to change the name of the cost function to `optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH` and then update `data_to_match` to not include the two arguments for ACTH data. To use the Yehuda Control group data, this would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data_to_match = [yehuda.controlCortisol[:,0], yehuda.controlCortisol[:,1]]\n",
    "    return optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH(data_to_match[0], data_to_match[1], simData)\n",

    "The cell directly under the heading **Save Output to File** should again have the filename changed to something that reflects the data set you're matching now. For instance, the filename root when matching the smoothed Carroll Control group and optimizing ICs would become:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filename_root = 'sriramModel_output/carroll-control-smooth-5-iterations-ICopt'\n",
    "            \n",
