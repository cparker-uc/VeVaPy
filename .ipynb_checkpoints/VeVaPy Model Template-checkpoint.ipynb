Or you can run against the mean of any subgroup using `nelson.<subgroup name>Cortisol_mean[:,1]` and `nelson.<subgroup name>ACTH_mean[:,1]` (for instance `nelson.melancholicCortisol_mean[:,1]` & `nelson.melancholicACTH_mean[:,1]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first column in each data set is the time steps, so indexing with `[:,0]` is referring to the time. These are the values we need to set as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices of the `data_to_match` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are several examples of lists you could use for parameter optimization with explanations:\n",

    "Next, you need to decide whether you will optimize any initial conditions (ICs). This can be modified in the function `cost_fun(params)`. In the cost function, we use the first two optimized parameters in the list returned by the optimization algorithm to set the ICs we want to optimize (CRH and GR in this example):\n",

    "    \n",
    "In that case, you will likely want to change the ICs for CRH and GR, as they will stay the same for every iteration. Under the heading **Run the Optimization**, the following line should be modified to reflect the desired ICs:\n",

    "    y0 = [0, data_to_match[1][0], data_to_match[3][0], 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Be sure to leave the 2nd and 3rd indices unchanged, as these set the ICs to use the initial values of the real-world data set being matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you are ready to run the optimization, so simply run the cells up to the heading **Save Output to File**. This may take some time, so while it is running you can move on to the next steps (if you run a cell while another is processing, it will add it to a queue).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You also have the option of using a cost function based on the maximum distance between simulation and real-world data. Simply change SSE_cost to MAX_cost, the instructions for function arguments remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell directly under the heading **Save Output to File** can be changed so that the root filename matches the simulations being run. This root will be used to save all of the various data and figures generated.

    "\n",
    "    t_end = 24.26\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note Also:** These data sets all come in smoothed versions (each data point is set to the average of the nearest 5 points of the unsmoothed data). Also, the data sets by Carroll, Golier and Bremner also come in rearranged (or smoothed & rearranged) versions to match the starting time of the Yehuda data (10AM). To use any of these versions, simply append one of the following tags to the end of the data set name (before the indices): `_smooth`, `_rearr`, or `_rearr_smooth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will cover what to do with data sets that contain both ACTH and cortisol values, and then afterwards I will cover using the Yehuda and Bremner data sets (which have only cortisol concentration data). Just as with the Nelson data, in all of these data sets the first column is the time step values. This means that if you take any of these arrays and index it with `[:,0]`, you are referring to the time steps. These are the values we need to use as the first (ACTH time steps) and third (cortisol time steps) indices in the `data_to_match` list.\n",

    "    - The Trauma-Exposed Control group mean for the Golier data set\n",
    "    \n",
    "In order to run simulations against data sets that do not include ACTH concentration data, you will need to change the name of the cost function to `optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH` and then update `data_to_match` to not include the two arguments for ACTH data. To use the Yehuda Control group data, this would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data_to_match = [yehuda.controlCortisol[:,0], yehuda.controlCortisol[:,1]]\n",
    "    return optimize.SSE_cost_noACTH(data_to_match[0], data_to_match[1], simData)\n",

    "    filename_root = 'sriramModel_output/carroll-control-smooth-5-iterations-ICopt'\n",
    "            \n",
